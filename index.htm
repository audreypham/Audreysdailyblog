	<h1 class="heading-font">Welcome to Audrey's blog</h1>
	<p style="margin-left:120px; margin-right:120px">This is it! I'm starting a new blog! I always wanted to begin my own blog for a long time. I made reasons for being a slacker 
	and avoiding things. Before this, I used notes on my phone to jog down my thoughts about things that had happened in my life (I still have a whole bunch of old notes in my 
	old Blackberry that I left at home in Vietnam. I created locks for them. I didn't want anyone to see all that 'cause they were usually incomplete thoughts so 
	I hid it. It would be so embarrassing if anyone saw it lol)<br>
	<br>For now, I will try to write more and show it here then maybe someday, someone in somewhere will see it and feel it with me!<br>

	<p style="font-style:italic; text-align: right">*Photo: This guy came right up to my camera for a pose - Safari World, Bangkok, Thailand</p>
	<p>...<br>
	I planned it quickly within a week, from purchasing airplane tickets to booking hostels for my stay in Thailand. I used up all my savings for the trip. I didnâ€™t tell anyone, 
	even my parents. The day before I boarded my first trip ever abroad, I talked to my mom. She went mad. She worried. She thought how a little girl (not little really lol, I was 21 
	at that time. But you know, Asian parents always think their children are still young and little) could possibly plan something that big, without telling her, alone. She tried to 
	convince me to cancel it. But everything was all set, the money was deposited. She had to let me go but still worried like sick.</p>
	<p style="font-style:italic">And I, needed to let me go, to the new world ahead of me.</p>
