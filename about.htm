	<p style="font-style:italic; text-align: right">*Audrey is my English name. My real name is Nhu. I will use Audrey for my identity in this blog</p>
	<p style="margin-left:10px; margin-right:10px">I am indeed an introvert. My type of MBTI is INFJ. I consider myself (and so as my type) as weird and complicated. Not that I intently 
	make myself like that, but I find it hard for others to understand me. I usually find myself have different thoughts from most of them but I don't usually 
	express it. I keep that to myself. That said, if someone tries to force their thoughts on me, I will agree with them, but I won't do as 'someone told me to'. 
	I'm different so I know it but in this society, being different is difficult. You would find yourself out of place and hard to join in among them.<br>
	</p>
	<p style="font-style:italic">In fact, before I acknowledge that I am an INFJ, I didn't know what was wrong with me. Why did I feel so lonely in this world?</p>
	<p>Then one day, I stumbled across a Youtube channel. Here, I felt myself, I felt others. That channel is called Frank James and his initial is FJ, like 
	an INFJ. I spent hours, days, weeks and months listened to him talk. That was when I knew how to accept myself with being different. INFJ is a rare personality 
	in the world. So, definitely we are different, as so other 15 personalities. I learned that if we wanted to survive in this world, we needed to fake ourselves, 
	to be someone else. And that is tough.<br>
	<br>That was also when I gradually opened myself up to all my close relationships. But sometimes I still find myself odd in expressing it. I know I need time 
	to adapt to it. And I will have my way to get it. Arggg, sometimes I just wished I was born again with a whole fresh mind and then I can get to be confident and 
	more active so I can loudly talk in front of people. I still don't understand why I am like this. I mean, my family and my relatives including my uncles, aunts, and cousins, 
	they are all extroverts, and I am the opposite way, an introvert.<br>
	<br>But it is what it is. I have to accept who I am. I have to be the person so that maybe someday I will do something that I can be proud of.
